# DIY-switch-bot

Hello! And if your reading this im gonna make a guess your trying to make your very own switch bot using a raspberry pi pico w and a simple micro servo 
if you are going to set this up yourself please follow the notes in the main.py and do not hesitate to message me with any issues. Just to let you know 
im very new to coding with reaspberry pis so I do not know much but will work my hardest to fix the issue just this may take some time. Thanks again
My discord: grog#2413 My email: harrygriggs167@gmail.com

Im also in the process of making a 3d printed case for this to make it look better and not have dangling wires everywhere. Please give me time to do this.
I will upload photos of my final result for reference.
